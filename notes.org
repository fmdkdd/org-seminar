* Emacs preliminary
VERY QUICKLY.

Emacs is better thought of as a /platform/ rathan than a text-editor.

- It's a Lisp machine
- Fully customizable
- [[info:Emacs][Self-documented]]

Multiple distributions (Prelude, Spacemacs, DOOM).

* Basic Org usage
It's like markdown, but better.

- It's just text!
- Write notes as headlines
- Built-in folding, tags, search
- How to store/write links
- Headlines can be TODOs
- Can contain SRC blocks

* Example 1: Keeping a research log
- Keep track of commands used
- Include screenshots
  - Show code of (simplified) insert-screenshot
- Tag headlines with topic
- Make links to papers, commits, other headlines
  - (maybe include links to pdftools?)

* Example 2: Tasks and Agenda
- Show workflow
  - Capture task
  - Show all tasks in agenda
  - Schedule/deadlines
  - Show week review
- Show tasks file

* Example 3: Keeping track of grades
- Built-in powerful spreadsheet
- Show off custom keybindings for faster input
- (Can export to CSV)

* Example 4: Write TP+Slides
- Intro to babel (Python+R ?)
- Use org-present
- Export to HTML for students with/without answers
  - Through EXCLUDE_TAGS

* Example 5: Discovery experiment
Interpreting results in Org+Babel+Python to HTML.
